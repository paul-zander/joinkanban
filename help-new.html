      <h1>Help</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using my kanban project
        management tool. Here, I'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it
        can benefit you, and how to use it.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
        group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
        the Developer Akademie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help
        users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise
        and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to
        ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
        availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality
        regarding Join.
      </p>
      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Exploring the Board</span><br />When you log in to Join, you'll
          find a default board. This board represents your project and contains
          four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
          "Done".
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Creating Contacts</span><br />In Join, you can add contacts to
          collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
          "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
          contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on
          the board.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Adding Cards</span><br />Now that you've added your contacts,
          you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
          the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill
          in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due
          date, assignees, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Moving Cards</span><br />As the task moves from one stage to
          another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
          the card from one list to another.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Deleting Cards</span><br />Deleting Cards Once a task is
          completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
          Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please
          exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
          Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from
          you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of
          your project.
        </li>
      </ol>
